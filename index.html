  <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Titanic</span></h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RMS Titanic shipwreck in 1912 had a positive impact on the&nbsp;</span>future regulations for cruise lines around the world. It taught future cruiselines how to handle a hazardous situation properly, such as the Titanic&rsquo;s, and to properly prepare companies cruise liners if there are problems on the high seas.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1912 a revolutionary ship was being erected in Harland and Wolff&nbsp;</span>Heavy Industries. &nbsp;This shipyard in Northern Ireland was holding a vessel that would peak the interest of many people and would engrave a memory in the shipping industry and mankind for years to come. &nbsp;On the 10th of April, it was a mourning of humanistic pride in the beautiful ship that waited in port to shove off to a long journey across the Atlantic. &nbsp;It would make berth New York, but never made it. The tragic events of April 14th 1912, could have prevented. &nbsp;Even if they still hit the iceberg they had many chances to have that night and upcoming mourning end differently than it had.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention of the wreck could have started long before the Titanic&nbsp;</span>could have even been in any danger of the iceberg. There were many warnings from other ships that saw the ice in the sea and tried to warn the Titanic. They were unsuccessful alerting the Captain, Edward John Smith.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did receive a warning, but it was recieved way before they were close to the ice. When they were closer to the ice the radio operator was know in range to send the many letters of the passengers aboard the Titanic to the port in New York. So when a telegram came from another ship the operator thought of it as another ship just calling them on the Radio. &nbsp;He told them to leave him alone because he had work to do. This could have been prevented by having only a certain number of letters passengers could write or only having the radio operator send a certain amount of letters in a certain amount of time. This in turn would free up more time for the operator to focus on more important things. Such as other incoming messages.</span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the night came upon the Titanic there was low visibility, so it was&nbsp;</span>tough to see far ahead of the vessel without binoculars. The crewmen in the crows nest and on the bridge where not given binoculars. There job was to spot icebergs, but it was hard to do there job because they couldn&rsquo;t see for enough. When they were able to see the iceberg they couldn&rsquo;t turn the boat fast enough to move out of the way. Some historian believe that the Titanic should have been built with a bigger rudder because it didn&rsquo;t move enough water to steer the ship effectively. Another theory was that of the speed of the ship. Captain Smith wanted to make good time to New York, so he kept the ship at full speed. This made it very difficult to steer the ship out of the way. &nbsp;Those were some of the leading theories on the Titanic&rsquo;s inadequate steering. The Titanic would have been better off slamming into the iceberg head on because the the crew would have closed off the watertight bulkheads in the front. &nbsp;With the side swipe though it opened four bulkheads too much for the huge ship to handle. &nbsp;After the hit the ship was doomed.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The designers of the Titanic didn&rsquo;t include enough life boats as everybody knows that. But they did! They only wanted lifeboats for 1st and 2nd class. This is still not enough though. &nbsp;Also they thought the Titanic itself was supposed to be a lifeboats in itself. When they started to load the lifeboats for the first few they packed them almost half full so the amount of people who were saved there could have been more. One sad thing about the wreck that the crew couldn&rsquo;t control was the temperature of the water. The water temperature was &shy;2&deg;C. &nbsp;<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Cd51-1000g.gif" alt="" width="512" height="155" /></span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a side note I went to a museum where they had a hole leading to a tank of water at that temp and you would stick your arm in and see how long you could keep it in there. I could only have mine in there for 15 sec the average person was 10. The people who were pulled from the water, less than 10, had to be in the water for over 3 min. So the pain they endured and strength required had to be immense. The one life boat that did come back didn&rsquo;t want to come earlier because the people would fight to get on the boat and capsize it. &nbsp;That was understandable because them going back and ending up in the water wouldn&rsquo;t have helped anybody.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closest ship to the Titanic was the California and they couldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;</span>message the ship because it wasn&rsquo;t as big as the Titanic and only had one Radio Operator, so the radio was off for the night. A way to improve this could have been to have enough operators to do around the clock shifts.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a mystery ship the Titanic could see as it was sinking. Even&nbsp;</span>though the ship shot signal flares no one knows why that mystery ship didn&rsquo;t come to the Titanic's rescue.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Titanic impacted future sea based travel and marine activity in many more ways than one. The Titanic left such a huge mark on the laws for maritime travel. Its been over 90 years since the wreck but the effects of the wreck still exist today. After the wreck of the Titanic many laws and regulations were passed in order to prevent similar catastrophes. For example, the US Government passed the Radio Act of 1912. This act stated that all passenger ships must have radio communications established 24 hours a day with a secondary supply of power in case of emergencies. </span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Titanic hit the iceberg, there was a confusion as to what to do because of the lack of preparedness and training of the crew. None of the crew members were trained on who to contact or how to contact using their radio. Ships are now required to have trained members on the crew that are capable of using the radio in a time of need as well as fixing them incase anything goes wrong.They also created a radio channel specific for emergencies in the ocean that would run for 24 hours. This act was put in place to make sure that a ship in distress is always able to radio for help. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea declared the signal of a red flare shot from a ship as a sign for help. </span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is put in place due to the fact that the Titanic had fired red rockets into the air but were misinterpreted by the crew members of the SS Californian who had seen the flares and believed they were to identify themselves to nearby ships. Following the sinking of the Titanic, the US Navy assigned Scout Cruisers to sweep the Grand Banks for any dangerous obstacles. The Chester and the USS Birmingham were involved in the International Ice Patrol and continued for the rest of 1912 following the Titanic.</span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 1912 the Revenue Cutter Service assumed authority over the International Ice Patrol after the US Navy claimed that they couldn&rsquo;t spare any of their ships. The Seneca and the Miami were sent on the expedition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titanic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disaster led to the convening of the first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) in London, on 12 November 1913. On 30 January 1914, a treaty was signed by the conference that resulted in the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol. Since the mid-1900s, planes and other aircraft vehicles have become the main form for ice patrol missions. Ships with more than 50 passengers were required to have enough lifeboats to accommodate for all the passengers and crew on board. This sounds like common sense but prior to the Titanic, ships were not required to provide a spot on a lifeboat for everyone and would have to pick and choose. </span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also changes in the way ships were made in order to prevent such things from happening again. Double hulls became the most important change made to the ships being built because it strengthened the ships in order to prevent ice and other obstacles from penetrating the ship. Bulkheads were also raised to prevent the waterline from reaching over the ship. Both changes were used to make the ships stronger in order to resist the obstacles such as icebergs and other natural and artificial structures that may compromise the ships and their passengers. </span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are still learning about the wreck and learning from the wreck to this day. After the Titanic&rsquo;s discovery there were many people who tried to salvage as many valuable items as they could from the wreck and some that succeeded. Due to this salvagery, the US Congress passed the R.M.S. Titanic Maritime Memorial Act of 1986 which regulates the research and salvage of the shipwreck by declaring it a memorial. </span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these precautions and regulations were in effect before the wreck of the Titanic, then it probably wouldn&rsquo;t have happened or if it did happen, they would be more than capable of saving everyone with little effort. However, the wreck of the RMS Titanic was a wake up call for the world.The world realized that nothing is truly invincible especially if the crew onboard is not properly trained and if the ship isn&rsquo;t properly equipped.</span></strong></p>
